## Executive Summary

E-Z Ship seeks to validate a new logistics and last-mile delivery concept through the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goal of this project is to design and demonstrate a functional, web-based MVP that proves core business concepts: multi-role user access, basic shipment tracking, and the ability for participating convenience stores to advertise available storage capacity. This proposal outlines the project's scope, approach, deliverables, assumptions, risks, and a high-level, non-technical milestone timeline suitable for executive review and approval.

## Client Need and Problem Statement

E-Z Ship leadership needs a tangible, working MVP to confirm feasibility, communicate the vision to stakeholders, and support future investment or expansion decisions. While E-Z Ship has an existing e-commerce environment, the immediate need is not a full production platform, but rather a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how drivers, customers, and participating stores interact within a single system.

The primary problem to be addressed is the lack of a unified, demonstrable platform that shows end-to-end flow from user sign-in through pickup, storage visibility, and delivery tracking. Without this MVP, it is difficult for leadership to validate assumptions, align stakeholders, or confidently plan next phases of development.

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to deliver an MVP that:

- Demonstrates a responsive website usable on both mobile and desktop devices.
- Supports multiple user roles, including customers, drivers, and convenience store partners.
- Provides basic shipment tracking from drop-off through final delivery.
- Integrates a map component to visually support location awareness.
- Presents a consistent look and feel across all user roles.
- Establishes a foundation for future security, scalability, and feature expansion discussions.

## Scope Overview

### In Scope

- A web-based MVP accessible via phone and computer browsers.
- User authentication for customers, drivers, and store partners.
- Store partner functionality to indicate available storage space in square footage.
- Basic database functionality to demonstrate data capture and retrieval.
- High-level shipment tracking workflow from pickup to delivery.
- Conceptual map integration for location visualization.

### Out of Scope

- Full production-grade e-commerce integration.
- Advanced security hardening beyond MVP needs.
- Performance optimization for large-scale usage.
- Ongoing monitoring, analytics, or patch management strategies.

## Key Assumptions

- The MVP is intended for demonstration and validation purposes, not full commercial deployment.
- The client will provide timely feedback and approvals to keep milestones on schedule.
- Weekly meetings will be sufficient to address questions, risks, and scope alignment.
- Initial security requirements will be discussed at a high level, with detailed controls deferred to later phases.

## Key Risks

- Ambiguity in feature expectations could lead to scope creep if not actively managed.
- Limited availability on either side (Capella Project Team and Client) may slow decision-making.
- Changes in priorities during development could impact timelines.
- Integration complexity with mapping or tracking components may require trade-offs at the MVP level.

## Communication and Governance

Communication will primarily occur via RIIPEN and email, with standing weekly meetings held once per week on Tuesdays or Wednesdays in the Eastern Time Zone. These sessions will focus on progress updates, issue resolution, and confirmation of next steps. The project lead will serve as the primary point of contact for coordination and reporting.

## Deliverables

- A working MVP website demonstrating core functionality.
- Role-based sign-in for users, drivers, and store partners.
- Demonstrated shipment tracking workflow.
- Store capacity visibility functionality.
- A documented roadmap outlining recommended next phases beyond the MVP.

## Success Metrics and MVP Acceptance Criteria

The success of the E-Z SHIP MVP will be evaluated based on its ability to clearly demonstrate the core business workflow and validate the underlying logistics concept. The MVP will be considered successful when the following criteria are met:

From a functional perspective, the MVP must allow users to successfully access the platform from both mobile and desktop devices and authenticate using role-based sign-in for customers, drivers, and convenience store partners. Each role must be able to complete its portion of the workflow without system failure or manual intervention.

From a workflow validation standpoint, the platform must demonstrate the complete lifecycle of an item, beginning with user booking or registration, followed by drop-off at a participating convenience store, storage visibility, pickup by a driver, and confirmation of delivery. The system does not need to optimize routes or handle exception scenarios, but it must clearly show handoffs between roles.

From a data and visibility perspective, the MVP must capture and display basic data elements that prove the system works as intended. This includes store-reported available storage space (measured in square footage), item status updates, and location awareness through map-based visualization or simulated tracking.

From a usability and experience perspective, the MVP must present a consistent look and feel across all user roles and provide intuitive navigation that can be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders during demonstrations.

From a stakeholder validation perspective, the MVP will be accepted once E-Z SHIP leadership confirms that the solution clearly represents the business concept, aligns with stated goals, and is sufficient to support early partner discussions and future planning.

## Non-Technical Milestone Timeline

### Milestone 1: Project Alignment and Approval

- **Due:** January 30th, 2026

Finalize project goals, confirm MVP scope, validate assumptions, and obtain formal sign-off on the proposal and roadmap.

### Milestone 2: Experience and Workflow Design

- **Due:** February 4th, 2026

Define user journeys for customers, drivers, and store partners. Confirm look and feel expectations and overall platform flow.

### Milestone 3: MVP Build and Configuration

Develop the MVP website, user sign-in functionality, basic tracking workflow, and store capacity features. This will be performed in iterations (Sprints) to ensure client expectations are met throughout the project's duration.

- **Milestone 3.1: Sprint 1 - Wireframe**
  - Due: February 15th, 2026
  - Present to client: February 18th, 2026
- **Milestone 3.2: Sprint 2 – Database build and user account creation**
  - Due: March 1st, 2026
  - Present to client: March 4th, 2026
- **Milestone 3.3: Sprint 3 – Website and POC feature set buildout**
  - Due: March 15th, 2026
  - Present to client: March 18th, 2026

### Milestone 4: Demonstration and Validation

- **Due:** March 20th, 2026
- **Present to client:** March 19th, 2026

Conduct live demonstrations with E-Z Ship leadership to validate that MVP goals and success criteria are met.

### Milestone 5: Feedback and Next-Phase Planning

- **Due:** March 20th, 2026

Collect client feedback, document lessons learned, and present recommendations for future enhancements, security considerations, and production readiness.

## Conclusion

This project provides E-Z Ship with a focused, low-risk opportunity to validate its delivery and storage concept through a functional MVP. By emphasizing clarity, usability, and demonstratable value, the proposed approach supports informed decision-making and positions E-Z Ship for confident next-step investments.
