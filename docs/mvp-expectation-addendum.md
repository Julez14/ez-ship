# **E-Z Ship MVP Expectation Addendum**

**E-Z SHIP**

**MVP EXPECTATION ADDENDUM**

_(Sponsor Clarification for Capella University Project Team)_

**Purpose of This Addendum**

This addendum is intended to clarify **qualitative expectations** for the E-Z Ship MVP beyond the original project scope, without expanding feature requirements or timelines. The goal is to ensure the MVP delivers **maximum strategic value** for E-Z Ship within the agreed 10-week timeframe.

**1. Core Intent of the MVP**

The E-Z Ship MVP is not intended to be a production-ready system. However, it **must be strong enough to be used in live conversations with potential partners**, including convenience store owners, drivers, and logistics stakeholders.

The MVP should allow the sponsor to _demonstrate_ the business concept clearly, without relying on hypothetical explanations or verbal walkthroughs of missing functionality.

**2. End-to-End Workflow Demonstration (Non-Negotiable)**

The MVP must support a **clear, uninterrupted demonstration** of the full item lifecycle:

1.  Customer registers or submits an item

2.  Item is dropped off at a participating store

3.  Store confirms storage and available capacity

4.  Driver picks up the item

5.  Item is delivered and marked complete

All handoffs between roles must be visible within the system through status changes or interface updates. Manual triggers or simulated logic are acceptable, provided the flow remains coherent and stable.

**3. Role-Specific Experiences**

Each user role must have a **distinct and purpose-built interface**, reflecting real-world responsibilities:

- **Customer:** item registration, tracking, delivery confirmation

- **Store Partner:** storage capacity input, stored item visibility, pickup confirmation

- **Driver:** pickup visibility, location context, delivery status updates

Generic admin-style screens should be avoided in favor of role-appropriate views that are understandable to non-technical users.

**4. Store Partner Experience Emphasis**

Because decentralized storage is central to the E-Z Ship model, the **store partner experience must be exceptionally clear and intuitive**.

At minimum, a store partner should be able to:

- Sign in

- Declare available storage space (e.g., square footage)

- View items currently in storage

- See when items are picked up or removed

The experience should be simple enough to explain to a store owner in under two minutes during a live demo.

**5. Map and Location Awareness**

Any map or location component included in the MVP must serve a **functional storytelling purpose**, such as:

- Showing store locations

- Providing context for item movement or status

Static or decorative maps that do not contribute to understanding the workflow should be avoided.

**6. Live Demonstration Readiness**

The MVP should be capable of supporting a **stable, uninterrupted live demonstration**, including:

- Pre-seeded demo data

- A clear "happy path" workflow

- No requirement for manual fixes or developer intervention during demos

The objective is confidence, not edge-case handling.

**7. Acceptable Use of Simulation**

The following are explicitly acceptable at the MVP stage:

- Simulated payments

- Simulated driver availability

- Manual status changes

- Hardcoded routes or mock notifications

These elements are acceptable provided the **user experience feels realistic** to external viewers.

**8. Success Definition**

The MVP will be considered successful when E-Z Ship leadership can confidently use it to:

- Explain the business model visually

- Validate operational assumptions

- Support early partner onboarding discussions

- Inform next-phase technical and business planning

**Closing Note**

This addendum does not expand scope, features, or timelines. It clarifies the **level of completeness, clarity, and usability** expected from the MVP to ensure it delivers real-world value beyond academic evaluation.
